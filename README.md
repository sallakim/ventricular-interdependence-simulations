Model run environment MATLAB R2022a.

The repository contains 5 primary folders ('Core', 'ExVivo', 'InVivo', 'LSA_codes', and 'OPT_codes') that pertain to the model. 

'RUN_exvivo_VL' and 'RUN_exvivo_VL_EDV' run the ex vivo model, with the latter simulating the experiment from Klotz et al., 2006.

'RUN_invivo_VL' runs the in vivo model with volume loading for the healthy and dysfunction cases. 

'VisualizeEDPVR_labeled' is a simulation video that depicts the TriSeg heart under the four dysfunction simulations for the severe case, and the healthy TriSeg heart.
